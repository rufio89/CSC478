A country guy goes into a city bar that has a dress code and the maitred' demands he wear a tie. Discouraged the guy goes to his car to sulk when inspiration strikes: He's got jumper cables in the trunk! So he wrapsthem around his neck sort of like a string tie (a bulky string tie to be sure) and returns to the bar. The maitre d' is reluctant but says to the guy "Okay you're a pretty resourceful fellow you can come in... but just don't start anything"!
